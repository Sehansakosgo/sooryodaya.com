    <div class="thumbnail" data-large-image="2.jpg" data-description="Physical activity refers to any bodily movement that requires energy expenditure. It encompasses a wide range of activities, from daily tasks like walking and climbing stairs to structured exercise routines such as jogging, swimming, or weightlifting. Engaging in regular physical activity offers numerous health benefits, including improved cardiovascular health, strengthened muscles and bones, enhanced mental well-being, and better weight management. Additionally, it can reduce the risk of chronic diseases like heart disease, diabetes, and certain cancers. The World Health Organization recommends adults aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic activity per week, along with muscle-strengthening activities on two or more days per week. Children and adolescents should engage in physical activity for at least 60 minutes each day. Incorporating physical activity into daily life can be enjoyable and fulfilling, contributing to overall physical and mental vitality.">

Sleep is a naturally recurring state characterized by reduced consciousness, decreased sensory activity, and altered brainwave patterns.

Adequate rest supports cognitive processes such as learning, memory consolidation, and decision-making. Furthermore, sleep plays a significant role in emotional regulation, with insufficient sleep linked to mood disturbances, irritability, and heightened stress responses.">
